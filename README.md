# fullstack-timer-with-auth

Project just has super low level basic authentication on it right now; massive work in progress

**TO DO**

- [x] two font css variables; one for UI one for timers
- [ ] Login and Logout button need same css font styling
- [ ] maybe similar label/input style as "creator" for login
- [ ] component for when there isn't any timers
- [ ] add timer countdown functionality and math
- [ ] consider days, hours, minutes, and seconds for timer
- [ ] sort timers by how much time is left; not by creation time
- [ ] when timer is 0 change timer color
- [ ] css styling for timers in general
- [ ] maybe consider model for base names, then user specific dropdowns
- [ ] svg image for "closer" and "adder"
- [ ] maybe use a web socket for timer CRUD actions
- [ ] maybe some art work for login screen; filling in the empty space
- [ ] theming engine (may require full component rewrite, way to much work)
- [ ] clean up css grids where not needed (thers is a lot of nested grids)
